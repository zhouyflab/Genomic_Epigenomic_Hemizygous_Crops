# The genomic and epigenomic landscapes of hemizygous genes
**The genomic and epigenomic landscapes of hemizygous genes across crops with contrasting reproductive systems**

This study provides a comprehensive analysis of hemizygous genes in diploid plants, highlighting their distinct characteristics compared to diploid genes. By examining 22 genomes from contrasting reproductive systems, we identify distinct evolutionary and functional features of these genes. Clonally propagated lineages are particularly replete with hemizygous genes, presumably due to the accumulation of heterozygous structural variants, but they are also common in outcrossing diploids. The hemizygous genes are expressed at lower levels than the expected 50% of diploid genes, perhaps due to enhanced DNA methylation of hemizygous genes and transposable elements. These insights enhance our understanding of plant genetics and offer valuable implications for crop breeding strategies in heterozygous genomes.
